# my-cats

title: my cats
hours worked: ~5 hours

it's just a presentation about my cats. i made this project with HTML, CSS, and JS! i made it just for funsies because i really like my cats. i also wanted to practice more javascript!

what i struggled with: i struggled a lot with centering everything and creating the outline box for some reason, but i got it to work.
what i learned: i learned how i can center items in the user's screen, how to delete items upon a button click, and how to play sounds upon a button click.
